# Push_swap

This project requires you to sort data within a stack using a limited set of instructions and with the fewest operations possible. To succeed, you will need to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using the provided Makefile.
3. Run the executable with appropriate arguments to test different scenarios and datasets.
4. Explore the codebase to understand the implemented algorithms and strategies.

## Usage
```bash
./push_swap [integer inputs]
